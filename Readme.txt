TIE Cockpit Editor
======================================

Author: Michael Gaisser (mjgaisser@gmail.com)
Version: 0.9.1
Date: 2015.01.26

This program allows viewing of TIE95 cockpit designs, with all views and
components. XvT uses a slightly different format than TIE95, attempting to read
those cockpits will likely result in errors.

This started mostly as a proof-of-concept with the intention to turn this into
an actual editor, but was abandoned due to lack of interest. I may pick this up
again as people are re-introduced to TIE thanks to GOG.com.
